For this graph, I took the **Part of Body** compared to the **Total Amount of Injuries** for the position of **Goalkeeper**
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(plotly)
library(ggiraph)
library(gganimate)
library(dplyr)

prem_league_stats <- read_excel("../Final-project/prem_league_stats.xlsx")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
prem_league_stats|>
select(part_of_body, injury, goals_overall, position, `Current Club`, age, full_name)|>
drop_na(part_of_body, injury)|>
filter(position == "Goalkeeper")|>
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = part_of_body,
                     fill = injury)) +
geom_bar(size = 1.75)+
labs(title = "Different Soccer Injuries Related to the Goalkeeeper",
     x = "Part of Body",
     y = "Total number of Injuries")
```
From this, we can takeaway that goalkeepers experience more lower body thigh injuries.
