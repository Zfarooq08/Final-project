For this graph, I took the **Part of Body** compared to the Total **Amount of Injuries** for the positions of **Defender**

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(plotly)
library(ggiraph)
library(gganimate)
library(dplyr)

prem_league_stats <- read_excel("../Final-project/prem_league_stats.xlsx")
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
prem_league_stats|>
select(part_of_body, injury, goals_overall, position, `Current Club`, age, full_name)|>
drop_na(part_of_body, injury)|>
filter(position == "Defender")|>
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = part_of_body,
                     fill = injury)) +
geom_bar(size = 1.75)+
labs(title = "Different Soccer Injuries Related to Defense",
     x = "Part of Body",
     y = "Total number of Injuries")
```

From this, we can takeaway that defenders experience more lower body thigh injuries. They also experienced lesser amounts of upper body head injuries.
